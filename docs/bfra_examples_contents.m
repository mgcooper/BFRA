%% Baseflow Recession Analysis Toolbox Examples
%  
% These examples provide an introduction to the toolbox. The purpose of these
% examples is to demonstrate a typical use-case for the main functions in the
% bfra toolbox. To explore the toolbox functions in more detail, see the
% <m2html/function_index.html Function Index>.

% * <bfra_example_1.html *Estimate recession constants: Point cloud*> shows how
% to detect recession events from a timeseries of observed streamflow discharge
% and estimate recession constants using the point cloud method. 
% * <bfra_example_2.html *Estimate recession constants: Pareto distribution*>
% shows how to detect recession events from a timeseries of observed streamflow
% discharge and estimate recession constants using a hybrid point-cloud and
% Pareto distribution fitting method.
% * <bfra_kuparuk.html *Estimate saturated aquifer thickness trends using
% baseflow recession analysis*> shows how to detect recession events from a
% timeseries of observed streamflow discharge and estimate recession constants
% using a hybrid point-cloud and Pareto distribution fitting method, and then
% estimate trends in the saturated aquifer thickness using a linearized solution
% to the nonlinear storage-discharge equation.
